# rule34.xxx for nerds
rule34.xxx - PHP keywords results to JSON (cuz i want everything but art cuz i don't want this)

# What can it do
Gives you a JSON response to a keyword instead of 'arte'. You can also save the JSON by ticking a box.
I also added a comment finder option.

Yes, i feel making this would've been twice as better than going on the website...
